# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: 7/19 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn Learning Course: JS Essential Training. Also read several articles on indiv focus of this challenge. 

**Thoughts** I want to continue my practice in Vanilla JS with a stronger focus on OOP: I'm certified to work Full Stack, but need more practice.

### Day 3: 7/21 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn Learning Course, practiced writing objects with methods and testing them.

**Thoughts** Methods confused me-now I know that they are just functions in an object.

### Day 6: 7/23 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn Learning Course-Object Classes and Constructors: practiced making Classes, importing them as modules, manipulating data, and writing data to html

**Thoughts** Writing object properties to specific html tags is harder than I thought: I ended up just displaying the whole object in normal (ugly) formatting.  I won't stress about it now-it will probably come up later.  I also can see if I can adapt something else that I do know to work with this.

### Day 7: 7/24 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Studied objects and constructors in "Javascript For Kids" by Nick Morgan

**Thoughts** Good book, but I wish it had Object Classes included, but they are quite new
  
### Day 8: 7/25 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Completed challenge in the Objects section of the LinkedIn JS course.  Also did a bit of microsoft training. 

**Thoughts** This is a good course, especially combined with the JS For Kids book. The book gave me a little extra help with methods. 

### Day 9: 7/26 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Practiced OOP, completed P section of course, planned out a practice app (animals making thier sounds)

**Thoughts** I'm excited to write my first OOP. I'm looking into how I want to do the images of the animals.
 
### Day 10: 7/27 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Got sucked into a rabbit hole researching and comparing apps.  Reviewed some practice code. Most of what I did today was really interview prep. 

**Thoughts** I didn't get to actually code today, but there was a lot of studying and research. 


### Day 11: 7/28 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Started writing out my code for the Animal Sound OOP that I mapped out on Tuesday, practiced interacting with the DOM. 

**Thoughts** This project will be fun.

### Day 12: 7/29 Friday
**Today's Progress**: Added Boostrap CDN to my Animal Sound Repo and modified existing DOM management to fit those tags.  

**Thoughts** I'm traveling so I will listen to "CodeNewbie" and my developer audiobook.  I'm hoping to get time to work tonight so I may update it then.

### Day 13: 7/30 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Due to traveling all day, I focused on researching different types of pipelines and reviewed OOP via online articles. I also saved someone's life, btw.  

**Thoughts** Researching on the go is doable, but it does not compare to actually coding. 

  
### Day 14: 7/31 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: I studied today and reviewed my LinkedIn.  I don't code on Sundays unless I have to.  

### Day 15: 8/1 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Interview prep, starting a new approach to algorithms. 

**Thoughts** I registered for HackerRank today.  
  
### Day 16: 8/2 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Interviewed via zoom, reviewed portfolio and made list of changes, started changing "SpeakSpeare", added a new object to "Animal Sounds", and completed a HackerRank challenge.   

**Thoughts** I am enjoying OOP and algorithms.

 ### Day 17: 8/3 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on re-structuring "SpeakSpeare", reading articles, studying algorithms.   

**Thoughts** I really don't like my css setup for "SpeakSpeare"  

 ### Day 18: 8/4 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: SpeakSpeare re-styling, intense algorithm study.   

**Thoughts** Big O! And I think I'll just redo SpeakSpeare - don't like the way it is set up. 

### Day 19: 8/5 Friday
**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn JS course: DOM manipulation, specifically querySelector practice.  Also started a new algorith course. 

**Thoughts** It's good to brush up on the DOM-it's easy to forget how the syntax for selectors work.  It's also nice that I can do it easily in the chrome browser.

**Thoughts** This log is kinda mundane and annoying...

 ### Day 21: 8/7 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Read "Algorithmic Programming" from No Starch Press
  
  
### Day 22: 8/8 Monday
**Today's Progress**: JS course, Did the MarkDown Tutorial, Started refactoring the scales repo. 
**Thoughts** I started a course today that I forgot I had bought on Udemy in 2020 **eyeroll**.

### Day 23: 8/9 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Scales repo, but didn't like the changes and retreated.  Spent time on MDN and Udemy. Practiced navigating the command line. 
**Thoughts** I'm mapping it out on paper and deciding how many seperate components I want it to have.

### Day 24: 8/10 Wednesday 
**Today**: Made new branch "rescale" of scales repo and combined two components into one. I also did a lot of css on it.  The form is working well, but I need to refactor my onSubmit function becuase I'm not even getting a console response:  **debugging time**!
  
### Day 25: 8/11 Thursday 
**Today**: Using "parseFloat" and "e.preventDefault" (after quite a lot of Chrome DevTools debugging and Stack Overflow searching) to get my gross, tare, net, and tons calculations to work on submit of the form. 
  
**Thoughts** I want to get them displaying on the page tomorrow.  I also want to set the calculation function to round it to two decimals (so I don't have eight digit responses in the tons hook). Later on, I want to set up a back end that will push results to data so it is recorded with date and time stamps for admin use.  

  
### Day 26: 8/12 Friday 
**Today**: Added new object to the Animal Sounds repo, reviewed arrays and sub-arrays on freecodecamp, added a new data set to Horror Films Repo, messed up Scales repo and had to retreat. 

### Day 27: 8/13 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Continued work on scales repo and did more JS LinkedIn Course. Experimented with classList modifications.
  
**Thoughts** There are many ways to manipulate the DOM to show the results of the scale calculations, but I need to commit to one instead of building it, deleting it, then rebuilding it a different way, for eternity.

  ### Day 28: 8/14 Sunday 
**Today**: Read up on JQUERY and DOM manipulation.  
  
  ### Day 29: 8/15 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Added a table to scale repo which will render calculation results to the DOM.  I'm researching what render method to use. 
  
**Thoughts** I think I will add a local data file to push data to so it can be stored and recalled.  I could pass these data props to the table function and render it that way.

### Day 30: 8/16 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Studied conditional functions and initialized a new repo which will allow users to select ice cream flavors, and availability will depend on a if/else statement. 
  
**Thoughts** I will start making more mini repos to practice basic concepts-its fun to have mini projects.

### Day 31: 8/17 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Reviewed classSelector methods, practiced using them in the console of my scale repo, and completed another section in my JS Udemy Course. 

**Thoughts** I am skimming through the Udumy Course because I had purchased it two years ago and didn't use it (??????), and have since learned the concepts. A review is a good idea, though.
