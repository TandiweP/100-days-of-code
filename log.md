# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: 7/19 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn Learning Course: JS Essential Training. Also read several articles on indiv focus of this challenge. 

**Thoughts** I want to continue my practice in Vanilla JS with a stronger focus on OOP: I'm certified to work Full Stack, but need more practice.

### Day 3: 7/21 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn Learning Course, practiced writing objects with methods and testing them.

**Thoughts** Methods confused me-now I know that they are just functions in an object.

### Day 6: 7/23 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn Learning Course-Object Classes and Constructors: practiced making Classes, importing them as modules, manipulating data, and writing data to html

**Thoughts** Writing object properties to specific html tags is harder than I thought: I ended up just displaying the whole object in normal (ugly) formatting.  I won't stress about it now-it will probably come up later.  I also can see if I can adapt something else that I do know to work with this.

### Day 7: 7/24 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Studied objects and constructors in "Javascript For Kids" by Nick Morgan

**Thoughts** Good book, but I wish it had Object Classes included, but they are quite new
  
### Day 8: 7/25 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Completed challenge in the Objects section of the LinkedIn JS course.  Also did a bit of microsoft training. 

**Thoughts** This is a good course, especially combined with the JS For Kids book. The book gave me a little extra help with methods. 

### Day 9: 7/26 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Practiced OOP, completed P section of course, planned out a practice app (animals making thier sounds)

**Thoughts** I'm excited to write my first OOP. I'm looking into how I want to do the images of the animals.
 
### Day 10: 7/27 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Got sucked into a rabbit hole researching and comparing apps.  Reviewed some practice code. Most of what I did today was really interview prep. 

**Thoughts** I didn't get to actually code today, but there was a lot of studying and research. 


### Day 11: 7/28 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Started writing out my code for the Animal Sound OOP that I mapped out on Tuesday, practiced interacting with the DOM. 

**Thoughts** This project will be fun.

### Day 12: 7/29 Friday
**Today's Progress**: Added Boostrap CDN to my Animal Sound Repo and modified existing DOM management to fit those tags.  

**Thoughts** I'm traveling so I will listen to "CodeNewbie" and my developer audiobook.  I'm hoping to get time to work tonight so I may update it then.

### Day 13: 7/30 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Due to traveling all day, I focused on researching different types of pipelines and reviewed OOP via online articles. I also saved someone's life, btw.  

**Thoughts** Researching on the go is doable, but it does not compare to actually coding. 

  
### Day 14: 7/31 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: I studied today and reviewed my LinkedIn.  I don't code on Sundays unless I have to.  

### Day 15: 8/1 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Interview prep, starting a new approach to algorithms. 

**Thoughts** I registered for HackerRank today.  
  
### Day 16: 8/2 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Interviewed via zoom, reviewed portfolio and made list of changes, started changing "SpeakSpeare", added a new object to "Animal Sounds", and completed a HackerRank challenge.   

**Thoughts** I am enjoying OOP and algorithms.

 ### Day 17: 8/3 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on re-structuring "SpeakSpeare", reading articles, studying algorithms.   

**Thoughts** I really don't like my css setup for "SpeakSpeare"  

 ### Day 18: 8/4 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: SpeakSpeare re-styling, intense algorithm study.   

**Thoughts** Big O! And I think I'll just redo SpeakSpeare - don't like the way it is set up. 

### Day 19: 8/5 Friday
**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn JS course: DOM manipulation, specifically querySelector practice.  Also started a new algorith course. 

**Thoughts** It's good to brush up on the DOM-it's easy to forget how the syntax for selectors work.  It's also nice that I can do it easily in the chrome browser.

 ### Day 21: 8/7 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Read "Algorithmic Programming" from No Starch Press
  
  
### Day 22: 8/8 Monday
**Today's Progress**: JS course, Did the MarkDown Tutorial, Started refactoring the scales repo.

2. [Scales Repo](https://github.com/TandiweP/scales) 
  

### Day 23: 8/9 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Scales repo, but didn't like the changes and retreated.  Spent time on MDN and Udemy. Practiced navigating the command line. 
**Thoughts** I'm mapping it out on paper and deciding how many seperate components I want it to have. 
  
**Link(s) to work**
1. [Scales Repo](https://github.com/TandiweP/scales) 
  
  
### Day 24: 8/10 Wednesday 
**Today**: Made new branch "rescale" of scales repo and combined two components into one. I also did a lot of css on it.  The form is working well, but I need to refactor my onSubmit function becuase I'm not even getting a console response:  **debugging time**!
  
### Day 25: 8/11 Thursday 
**Today**: Using "parseFloat" and "e.preventDefault" (after quite a lot of Chrome DevTools debugging and Stack Overflow searching) to get my gross, tare, net, and tons calculations to work on submit of the form. 
  
**Thoughts** I want to get them displaying on the page tomorrow.  I also want to set the calculation function to round it to two decimals (so I don't have eight digit responses in the tons hook). Later on, I want to set up a back end that will push results to data so it is recorded with date and time stamps for admin use.  

  
### Day 26: 8/12 Friday 
**Today**: Added new object to the Animal Sounds repo, reviewed arrays and sub-arrays on freecodecamp, added a new data set to Horror Films Repo, messed up Scales repo and had to retreat. 

### Day 27: 8/13 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Continued work on scales repo and did more JS LinkedIn Course. Experimented with classList modifications.
  
**Thoughts** There are many ways to manipulate the DOM to show the results of the scale calculations, but I need to commit to one instead of building it, deleting it, then rebuilding it a different way, for eternity.

  ### Day 28: 8/14 Sunday 
**Today**: Read up on JQUERY and DOM manipulation.  
  
  ### Day 29: 8/15 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Added a table to scale repo which will render calculation results to the DOM.  I'm researching what render method to use. 
  
**Thoughts** I think I will add a local data file to push data to so it can be stored and recalled.  I could pass these data props to the table function and render it that way.

### Day 30: 8/16 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Studied conditional functions and initialized a new repo which will allow users to select ice cream flavors, and availability will depend on a if/else statement. 
  
**Thoughts** I will start making more mini repos to practice basic concepts-its fun to have mini projects.

### Day 31: 8/17 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Reviewed classSelector methods, practiced using them in the console of my scale repo, and completed another section in my JS Udemy Course. 

**Thoughts** I am skimming through the Udumy Course because I had purchased it two years ago and didn't use it (??????), and have since learned the concepts. A review is a good idea, though.

### Day 32: 8/18 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn JS course, added table component to Scales repo.  It shows the table but is not rendering the data...

**Thoughts** I think I should push the calculation to a json data file, then pull that in to the table file.  I want it to be accessible data anyway, and this will help.

### Day 33: 8/19 Friday
**Today's Progress**: I completed the first module for Azure training and did a lot of Microsoft 365 setting up/modifying for Porter Truck Repair. I also worked on the Ice Cream Menu css for fun and listened to an episode about the advantages of using Vanilla JS over frameworks. 
  
  
### Day 34: 8/20 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Spent 9hrs doing Microsoft Admin things for Porter Truck Repair.  Most of it was researching and implementing cloud integrations and literally set up a new desktop so it would be AS SIMPLE TO USE AS POSSIBLE. I enjoyed this work, but only had a bit of time to do "fun" coding tonight. 

  
  ### Day 35: 8/21 Sunday 
**Today**: Read up on Algorithm structure and approach.  
  
  ### Day 36: 8/22 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Traveled a lot so I listened to three different podcast episodes on algorithms and technical interviews. When I got home, I did some reviewing of block and inline elements on my Udemy course. I then worked on onClick functions for my Ice Cream repo buttons. 
  
**Thoughts** I can sure get sucked in to css haha. Spent way too much time experimenting with button alignment, borders, margin, etc.

### Day 37: 8/23 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Udemy course review of html semantics.  Went through various websites inspecting elements and seeing wether they have Semantic Elements or are just piles of divs. 
  
**Thoughts** I actually did not know about entity codes, which is a bit embarassing! When I've put the copyright symbol, etc. in my html, I've made it SOO difficult for myself by actually using svg's and jpegs! It was so simple all along lol.

### Day 38: 8/24 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: A little Udemy and LinkedIn course, which spurred big ideas that led me to change the table format in the Scales repo and test manually appending articles (with Animal Objects) in "Animals" repo. 
  
**Thoughts** Having a great time but the ADHD brain is FLEXING today. If I was Carrie, this house would be screwed lol.

### Day 39: 8/25 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Studied proper table html syntax and organization on the Udemy course. I practieced by adding a table with flavor, price, and stock status to my ice cream repo.  
  
**Thoughts**  I'm itching to css the table, but I believe I make things harder for myself when I start formatting things before they are actually completely structured (I need to do Colspan and Rowspan). Plain html pains me, but I need to get used to it so that I can put of styling until it's done.

### Day 40: 8/26 Friday
**Today's Progress**: After doing a Code Wars kata which convertered speed from kilometoers per hour to centimeters per second, I created a practice repo which converts Cheetah speed from mph to kph. It has a bug which is making the output always 0, so I will come back to it this afternoon. 

**Thoughts**  Making lot's of mini projects for practice is really fun - today I focused on using semantic html and experimented with Emmet VSCode shortcuts as I created the converter.

### Day 41: 8/27 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Very important personal day, so I did not do much. I did listen to a couple of Code Newbie podcasts and brainstorm. 
  
### Day 42: 8/28 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Reviewed several website formats and brainstormed. 

### Day 43: 8/29 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Completed Table section of the Udemy course.  Added to and stylized the Ice Cream Price table in my Ice Cream Menu repo.  
  
**Thoughts**  My table is in an html file for simplicity, but I think I will make it a JS object by moving into into a .js file and assigning it a variable and assigning that to the DOM.

### Day 45: 8/31 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: I had a really bad flare up of concussion symptoms today, so I wasn't able to code much.  The coding I did was to add hover effects to links and buttons in the Ice Cream Repo. I also listened to my coding audiobook on the early morning hike that triggered my flare up of vertigo, headache, eye pain, and brain fog. Yay! 
  
**Thoughts**  The hike seemed like a good idea at the time.  I forgot it's only been three weeks since the concussion. Silly me.

### Day 46: 9/1 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Had a lot of fun adding new input to my icecream flavor form as I got ideas watching Udemy.  I also made changes to the Scales repo because I randomly realized a couple of bug solutions. 
  
**Thoughts**  Good afternoon coding.  It's weird to be holding off on the JS for the most part, but reviewing html and css is doing me a lot of good.

### Day 47: 9/2 Friday
**Today's Progress**: Added validation to my ice cream request form, then added a new html file with a form for ordering.  I have it mostly set up - just need to refine the radio inputs.  Also added validation to scales repo form. 
  
**Thoughts**  Having fun with my ice cream repo. Seeing the pro's and con's of having forms as js objects vs html files.

### Day 48: 9/3 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML section of the Udemy bootcamp. It has been a GREAT review and filled in a few holes in my training. My ice cream repo is really fun so far and I look forward to adding js to it.  I also started a "Book Store" js challenge which is OOP and is provided with verbal instructions, which is more realistic for interview situations. 
  
**Thoughts**  I had trouble with my radio inputs until I realized I had different names set to each one!

### Day 50: 9/5 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Continued Udemy CSS section and did a lot of work modifying radio inputs, nav links, and buttons in the ice cream repo.

### Day 51: 9/6 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Udemy CSS attributes, selectors, ids, classes review.  Changed buttons in Ice Cream Repo using css selection methods I don't typically use. 
  
**Thoughts**  Some selection methods are really irksome.

### Day 54: 9/9 Friday
**Today's Progress**: Finished Udemy CSS Selectors section and started the Box Model section.  I updated my MongoDB Bank Database and realized upon pulling up the bank itself that the link in my portfolio to it is actually linking to the older, unconnected, crappier one. So I updated that link and logged in to make sure that my database reflected changes.  Happy camper. 
  
**Thoughts**  I'm embarassed that my portfolio had a lame link for the last few months! BLUSH BLUSH BLUSH

### Day 55: 9/10 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: I got my js converter working in the cheetah repo.  The key problem was that was was not grabbing the value of the input when I used querySelectorAll.  I also started using a color pallete and playing with shapes and sizes.  
  
**Thoughts**  Another long day, and although I'm not a night owl, I sure seemed to have some brain juice tonight!

**Today's Progress**: Read up on objects and methods-got some ideas for my OOP Animal Sounds repo. I also started digging into the canvas. 
  
### Day 57: 9/12 Monday
**Today's Progress**: More Udemy box-model.  I modified some of the Cheetah repo, but spend at least two hours getting my Animal Sounds repo working (re-did some of the object constructs, re-did cards,...).
  
**Thoughts**  My Animal Sounds repo is going to be cute.

### Day 59: 9/14 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Udemy CSS opacity/alpha and position. Experimented with a couple of repos.  As part of a joke, I started a magazine landing page. 
  
**Thoughts**  I use the opacity property frequently, but did not actually know that alpha was a thing (or forgot it).

**Today's Progress**: Had a meeting go WAAYY longer than I thought tonight, so I only got some practice in.  I think it totalled to about an hour.  It was mostly positioning things and doing other styles on my gag magazine repo.  
  
**Thoughts**  Chose to stay up and do this after a long day-hope these late nights pay off :).

### Day 61: 9/16 Friday
**Today's Progress**: A bit frustrating today-work went WAAAY over and destroyed my brain so just looking at a screen makes my eyeballs want to ditch their cute little cupcake holders.  I tried doing Udemy but my brain is done.  Ended up doing just a bit of css.  
  
**Thoughts**  Glad I at least listened to coding stuff today :\

### Day 62: 9/17 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Enjoyed starting CSS Animations on Udemy.  I added a new page to the Ice Cream repo in which I worked on having a circle fall onto a cone (like an ice cream cone, yo). The dropping circle is easy-its getting the cone to be the right shape and not go down with the circle that's a bit tough. I changed margins on hover and that helps a bit, but there is still space.  I'll have to inspect other box model properties there-maybe there's a padding set that I don't realize. 
  
**Thoughts**  You know I love CSS and now it MOVES! But how do I keep the cone beneath from moving with it..?

### Day 63: 9/18 Sunday 
**Today**: Added experience to Parker Dewey and applied for jobs.   

### Day 64: 9/19 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Finished Udemy CSS Transition/transformation section.  Did a code-along to chanage buttons in my animal repo and also went into the ice cream repo and fixed the cone so that it was the right size using transform(scale).  
  
**Thoughts**  I should have finished the video on Saturday instead of spending over an hour messing with the cone lol cry.

### Day 66: 9/21 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Udemy background image. I was experienced with it but picked up a couple of very useful tips.  Set a photo I'd taken of a truck engine a couple years ago as the background image of the Porter Truck Repair website. 
  
**Thoughts** Too bad I can't mess with opacity of the image without messing with the text, too. I will either get fancy with selectors/pseudo elements or just do opacity adjustments to the image itself in photoshop.

### Day 68: 9/23 Friday

### Day 69: 9/24 Saturday

### Day 70: 9/25 Sunday
**Today's Progress**:  Family Search, looked at websites with specific styles. 
  
### Day 71: 9/26 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Started Udemy Flexbox and followed along with the contact page of the Porter Truck Repair Repo. I had reviewed flexbox while standing in line at Dollar Tree for twenty minutes, so that helped. I use it a lot but I forget main/cross axis rules and orientations. I also fixed css on the arrow links so they were no longer invisible haha. 
  
**Thoughts** You really can get things done while standing in line.

### Day 72: 9/27 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Continued Udemy flexbox and learned that I had been messing myself up all along with how I used the "flex-items" property.  I used my new understanding to fix my Animal Sounds cards. I also added a Navbar. 
  
**Thoughts** I should just keep a flexbox ref open all the time.  Tattoo on my forearm???

### Day 73: 9/28 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Finished Udemy flexbox section. Added flex grow properties to Animal Sounds cards.

### Day 74: 9/29 Thurssday
**Today's Progress**: Coudn't focus on Udemy (long stressful work day), so I decided to have fun trying out styling techniques I've studied recently and restyled the gag magazine repo I made. 
  
**Thoughts** I think I will make the button to subscribe be a link to webMd's Narcissist diagnosis.

### Day 75: 9/30 Friday
**Today's Progress**: Because I was on the road 10+ hours today with work, I am having a very difficult time focusing on and takin in instruction.  I hope when I get back to my regular schedule, I'll be able to move forward.  Tonight I settled on added text shadow and other styles to the Porter Truck Repair repo. 
  
**Thoughts** Getting anxious to write some JS-it's been a minute (focusing on CSS lately).

**Today's Progress**:  Listsened to Code Newbie. 
  
### Day 78: 10/3 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Did media queries on Animal Sounds repo (successfully).  The Udemy course now has a code-along pricing panel, so I added a service calls pricing panel to my Porter Truck Repair site.  I have started it and added custom icons.  Looking forward to doing more.   
  
**Thoughts** I want to go back and fix responsive issues with other sites-especially those on my portfolio.

### Day 79: 10/4 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Continued Udemy code along (pricing panel that I'm modifying for Porter Truck Repair Service Calls).  I transferred the css to it's own sheet when I was introduced to CSS Reset, which is a very new and beautiful thing to me. I've seen it in other people's code, but always thougth it was something complicated that went over my head. WRONG! 
  
**Thoughts** CSS reset, where hast thou been all my life?

### Day 80: 10/5 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Started Udemy Bootstrap section.  Created a Podcasts repo to have a new project to work on that has both a css sheet and Bootstrap. 
  
**Thoughts** It will be fun to go over Bootstrap again.

### Day 81: 10/6 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Udemy Bootstrap containers and buttons.  Coded along with the podcasts repo. 
  
**Thoughts** I thought I knew Bootstrap really well, but I completely missed the purpose of containers. My life would have been SO MUCH EASIER if I'd used them in my Capstone instead of regular divs.

### Day 82: 10/7 Friday
**Today's Progress**: Finished Udemy Bootstrap basic section (tonight made a js deactivatable alert and did a practice section). I also listened to about an hour of "The Pragmatic Programmer" on the drive.  Understood about 50-60% of it. I did like the idea to make your code crash early so it doesn't crash it later and you have to dive back to figure things out. I also want to learn how to "decouple" functions because that is definitely an issue with me. 
  
**Thoughts** Proud of myself for coding after a looong day.  Glad I finished a Bootstrap Udemy section. Here comes the grid!

**Today's Progress**: Started Bootstrap Grid System on Udemy.  Added another html page for the horror genre to my Podcasts repo which has rows and columns displaying info about specific episodes.

### Day 84: 10/9 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Contacted a local business via Messenger about making a free website. It's a two woman business which decorates porches and provides tiers of service. St. G News had done a piece on them. Surprised they immediately responded with enthusiasm.  A little freaked about that. Will schedule a meeting? Also added Bootstrap Navbar to Podcasts home.

### Day 86: 10/11 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: In anticipation of an insane day, I coded in the morning.  I only did 30 min and it involved revising some things on the MAN repo (which needs a LOT of attention, but it was a joke at the time of conception so I may just delete it). I also listend to a coding podcast on my long drive.  
  
**Thoughts** Proud of myself for coding BEFORE my big day started.

**Today's Progress**: Bootstrap Grid Utilities on Udemy. Changed navbars and reviewed options for alignment.  Added a contact.html page in anticipation of doing Bootstrap Forms next.   
  
**Thoughts** I need to review tying custom css to Bootstrap-how do I do it without messing everything up? I have used inline styling with this in the past, but I'd rather have it in the css file.
