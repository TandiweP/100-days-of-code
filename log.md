### Day 1: 7/19 Tuesday

**Thoughts** I want to continue my practice in Vanilla JS with a stronger focus on OOP: I'm certified to work Full Stack, but need more practice.

**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn Learning Course, practiced writing objects with methods and testing them.

### Day 6: 7/23 Saturday
**Today's Progress**: LinkedIn Learning Course-Object Classes and Constructors: practiced making Classes, importing them as modules, manipulating data, and writing data to html

**Thoughts** Writing object properties to specific html tags is harder than I thought: I ended up just displaying the whole object in normal (ugly) formatting.  I won't stress about it now-it will probably come up later.  I also can see if I can adapt something else that I do know to work with this.

### Day 7: 7/24 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Studied objects and constructors in "Javascript For Kids" by Nick Morgan

**Thoughts** Good book, but I wish it had Object Classes included, but they are quite new
  
### Day 8: 7/24 Monay
**Today's Progress**: Completed challenge in the Objects section of the LinkedIn JS course.  Also did a bit of microsoft training. 

**Thoughts** This is a good course, especially combined with the JS For Kids book. The book gave me a little extra help with methods.
